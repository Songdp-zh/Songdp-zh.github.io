I am currently working toward the M.S. degree with School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, supervised by Prof. [Chengying Gao](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/content/2537) in [Intelligent and Multimedia Science Laboratory](https://www.sysu-imsl.com/members.html). I received the B.S. degree in computer science and technology from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Sichuan, China, in 2018, respectively.

My research interests include computer Graphics and computer Vision, specifically for cartoon-based image editing (AIGC).

![Editing a markdown file for a talk](/images/editing-talk.png)The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
